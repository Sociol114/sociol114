title: "Working with data"

> This topic is covered on Jan 7.

Data science is a world of abundant opportunities. Over recent decades, the field has been transformed by the rapid growth of both computational power and available data. With the proliferation of new technological advances and data opportunities, a social scientist might reasonably ask: where do I begin?

A good place to begin is to first 

1. Choose a question data can answer
2. Work with data to answer the question

We will first talk about how to ask a good question that data can answer. Then, we will begin preparing our computers with software and tools to answer those questions. Over the quarter, we will develop the skills to ask our own questions and find data to answer them.

<!-- It is important that (1) precedes (2). You have to first choose a good research question, and one where it is clear that quantitative data can provide a compelling answer. Only then are you prepared to begin analyzing data to answer the question. -->

<!-- Too often, social data scientists fall into the problem of first applying the latest tools and then reverse-engineering a question from the output of those tools. By starting with the question, you remain in charge and apply data science tools to questions that matter. -->

<!-- ## What questions can data answer? -->

<!-- Quantitative data are good at answering quantitative questions: -->

<!-- * what proportion of the U.S. labor force is employed? -->
<!-- * on average over the U.S. population without college degrees, how much higher would annual income be if a randomly chosen individual had counterfactually finished a four-year program? -->

<!-- These questions involve an outcome variable (employment), a unit of analysis for which it is defined (a person), and a target population (the U.S. labor force). Questions that data can answer may involve factual outcomes (employment) or counterfactual outcomes (annual incomes that would have been realized if a non-college-graduate had completed college). -->

<!-- ## What questions can data not answer? -->

<!-- One class of questions that data cannot answer are normative questions: questions about what should be. We might study inequality out of normative beliefs about value of fairness and equality, but data cannot tell us that the unemployment rate is too high or whether it is right or wrong that people would earn higher incomes if they counterfactually completed college. -->

<!-- Data also cannot tell us whether a fact is important---is it important that X\% of the labor force is unemployed? Data can help us make quantitative summaries, but the importance of those summaries requires an argument. -->

<!-- ## What comes next -->

<!-- This course takes socioeconomic inequality as a focal area of application. Inequality is a topic full of debate and normative arguments. We will seek to produce quantitative summaries of inequality that may inform these debates. While we will refrain from discussing what should be, knowing what is can be helpful in these debates. -->

<!-- Practically, the first part of the course will set up our computing environment, which encompasses both your computer's operating system and software installed on that operating system. Instead of using point-and-click approaches, we will analyze data by writing code. A code script is a set of sequential instructions: it tells the computer to first do this, then do that, then report a result in a chosen way. By learning to write code, you will rapidly expand the set of data science tools available to you. Perhaps more importantly, your work will become reproducible: someone else with your raw data should be able to run your code and produce exactly the same result. -->
