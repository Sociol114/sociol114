format: pdf

**Due: 5pm on Friday, January 10.**

Welcome to the first problem set; this should not require any extra input from
you. Just follow the instructions on the website to render this document. Then submit two things:

1) Upload the rendered PDF to BruinLearn
2) In our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMxlewBaz7QJ3uKNCsj2g5rukOOumqrZVAnu-ckybbfwvFsg/viewform?usp=sf_link), tell us your anonymous identifier that appears in your rendered PDF.

# Anonymous identifier

This code will generate you an anonymous 4-digit identifier for the quarter.

```{r}
anonymous_id <- sample(x = 1000:9999, size = 1)
```

Your anonymous identifier is **`r anonymous_id`**. You will identify yourself by this identifier instead of by your name on all problem set PDFs.

# Computing environment

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
