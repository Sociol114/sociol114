Working with data to understand inequality brings me joy and meaning, as I first discovered as a college student years ago. I hope to share that joy with you! Other joys of mine include hiking, surfing, and oatmeal with blueberries.

I am interested in studying the many ways that technology and society interact. My background is in computer science and software engineering, so I really enjoy bringing those tools to sociologists. Outside of work I enjoy crafting, gaming, and obsessing over my two adorable cats.
