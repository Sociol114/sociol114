**Due: 5pm on Friday, January 10.**

To complete the problem set, download <a href="../assets/pset0/pset0.qmd" download>pset0.qmd</a> and render to a PDF.

You will then submit two things:

1) Upload the rendered PDF to BruinLearn
2) In our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMxlewBaz7QJ3uKNCsj2g5rukOOumqrZVAnu-ckybbfwvFsg/viewform?usp=sf_link), tell us your anonymous identifier that appears in your rendered PDF.

## Help with gettinngs tarted

If you are stuck, make sure that you first follow the installation instructions in [setting up your computer](../topics/r_basics.qmd).

Open the downloaded problem set in RStudio. You should then click
the "Render" button as shown in the image below.

![](../assets/pset0/render.png)
This will run the R code and combine the output with the text in the document
into a PDF. By default, this PDF will be output in the same directory that
you saved `pset0.qmd` in. You will then submit the PDF on Canvas.
