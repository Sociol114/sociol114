could make the Cheng paper questions part of the next discussion
+ what makes this graph compelling?
+ how could it be made better?

Reading questions on England paper could become part of next discussion (pset 2)

discussion can look at firstname after pset 3

TO DO:
- Make rubric for pset 1
- Check rubric on pset 2

No peer review on pset 0 (need to update Github)
No peer review on pset 4 (need to write to be easy to grade)

might remove conceptual sampling questions pset 2



pset 1, 2, 3 are good to go
